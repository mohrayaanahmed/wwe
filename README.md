A two-player simple WWE card game that trumps one player against the other, and the player that has the highest points at the end of the game wins.
There are 40 wrestlers in the game, each assigned a rank, poppularity, height and weight.
When a player's card beats another player's card via rank, height, weight or popularity, that player is awarded a point.
The game is ended when all 40 cards are displayed and done.
There are three outcomes when a player's card is fighting another player's card, either win, lose, or draw. Only a win will be awarded a point.   
The player with the highest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.
